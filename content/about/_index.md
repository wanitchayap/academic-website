## Name
* **Nak Won** is my first name and **Rim** is my last name. I am fine with people calling me just Nak, but please do not think Won is my middle name or my last name is Won Rim.
* The **"Nak"** in my name is pronounced closer to the English word **"knock"** than **"neck"**. I do not really care about how people pronounce my name, as long as it is in the same ballpark.

## Outside Psychology and Neuroscience
* I like reading short stories and novels, especially English novels. My favorite authors are Kurt Vonnegut and Ernest Hemingway. I have pride that I read _Ulysses_ by James Joyce from top to bottom. I try to keep up with reading Korean novels too, but it got harder after coming to America.
* I also like talking about baseball stats and listening to music. I support whatever team that is based on the city my partner lives in (currently Toronto Bluejays) although she has absolutely no interest in the sport. I always claim that Beethoven's 5th movement of Beethoven's Symphony 9 is probably the best music ever written, but usually listens to classic rock music (or the Beetles).
