This page is designed to show some parts of me that did not make it to the front page!

## Name
* **Nak Won** is my first name and **Rim** is my last name. I am fine with people calling me just Nak, but please do not think Won is my middle name or my last name is Won Rim.
* The **"Nak"** in my name is pronounced closer to the English word **"knock"** than **"neck"**. I do not really care about how people pronounce my name, as long as it is in the same ballpark.

## Brief Life Trajectory

I was very interested in biology during elementary school and middle school. I was a member of the science education academy for the gifted at a national university and won a prize in the Korean Biology Olympiad Middle School Division. I raised two lab mice, which I got from one of my uncles who worked in a laboratory, named _PPalgannoon_ and _hweendoingeui_. I spent my free time reading about insects, especially ants.

This interest in biology led me to a high school for the gifted named [Korean Minjok Leadership Academy](http://english.minjok.hs.kr/). I took the entrance exam as a biology major and kept on taking Biology courses throughout my time at the school, eventually getting passing the AP exam in Biology. However, the school offered a variety of courses in diverse disciplines ranging from ancient Chinese text reading to JAVA programming. I took a course in AP Psychology during my sophomore year. The course was centered around a lot of classical results in Psychology, and one of the experiments it talked about was the Iconic Memory and the Sperling partial report paradigm. Upon hearing about the experiment, I was awestruck by the fact that the experiment was so succinct but informative at the same time. I thought it was almost beautiful. One thing led to others after that, and I ended up in as a Psychology major at Korea University.
Of the vast subfields of Psychology, I gradually realized that I was interested in the more cognitive and biological division of Psychology. I started studying statistics on my own during my mandatory military service. (I was stationed in an office because I was an interpreter, which let me have more regular working hours) After discharge from the military, I chose Brain Cognitive Science as my second major to take courses from the Department of Computer Science & Engineering and the Department of Biological Science. I realized that my research interests were closely related to cognitive control, so I worked as an undergraduate RA in Professor Choâ€™s lab.

Upon graduation, I decided that I would like to get deeper training in computational techniques and statistical modeling, so I joined the Masters in Computational Social Science program at the University of Chicago. I hope the training the program provides and the research experience I get from the Environmental Neuroscience Lab will help me to prepare myself better to answer the questions I have about cognition.
