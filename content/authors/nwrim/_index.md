Hi! I am currently a graduate student in [Masters in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu) in the University of Chicago. I am also a research assistant in the [Enviornmental Neuroscience Lab](https://voices.uchicago.edu/bermanlab/).

I received my B.A. degree in psychology and B.S. degree in Brain Cognitive Science at Korea University, Republic of Korea. As an undergraduate, I conducted experiments using classical distractor tasks such as Simon task and Stroop tasks to investigate cognitive control of humans. In ENL, I am assisting in projects related to various topics such as self-control and visual attention. My research interest centers on top-down control and executive functions, and I am learning and applying various methodology, such as brain-imaging, statistical modeling, behavioral experiments and computationally-enriched observations.
