I read the introduction written for _Titus Andronicus_, commonly known as the first tragedy Shakespeare wrote, by Professor David Bevington today. I read the play a couple of years ago and do not remember the full details of the play. But I remember that I found it somehow less Shakespearean. The article explained nicely why I felt that way â€“ this play was perhaps the only play written by The Bard that was heavily influenced by other plays of that era. It basically shares the most component and grammar of the revenge plays written in the 1950s (strongly influenced by _The Spanish Tragedy_). It contains direct references to classical authors such as Horace, which Shakespeare seldom does in his later stages.

This introduction somehow gave me a lot of relief. Even the most important English writer started with heavily referencing others. The playwright who later writes _Romeo and Juliet_ and _King Lear_ started with a play that is later called

> one of the stupidest and most uninspired plays ever written

by T. S. Elliot. Everybody starts somewhere. You cannot be original and awesome at the very beginning.
