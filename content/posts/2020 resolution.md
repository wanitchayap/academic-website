I recently talked with a close friend who studies Chemical and Biological Engineering. He told me that his lab has the policy to write a short progress report every weekday, so the lab director can keep track of what is happening in the lab. He said that although this policy was intended to help the director, it helps him keep track of the things and motivates him to be more consistent and tenacious.

While talking about new year’s resolutions with a different set of friends, I realized that the progress report system could also benefit me, too. Since I recently finished setting up a new website, I thought it might be a good idea to post my progress on a certain basis. I guess that will be my new year’s resolution – consistently monitoring my progress and writing brief reports on what I have done. I think a weekly schedule will be good, so I will upload something every Saturday. The content will be the lab work I had done, the course assignment/reading I had done, the articles/books I read, etc.
